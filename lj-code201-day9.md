Apparently the hardest part of 201 is over. Three days of nonstop JS was seriously wearing me out, so I'm glad we all can get a small break. Thursday and Friday are mostly going to be spent working on styling our cookie stand pages. Which is nice because we haven't really dedicated a whole lot of time in regards to CSS.

I think we're going to be watching some presentations tomorrow, one of which includes a Python project, so that's gonna be pretty cool.
